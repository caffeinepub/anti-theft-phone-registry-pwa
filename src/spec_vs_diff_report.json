  "summary": "REQ-1 and REQ-3 appear implemented via a new TanStack Router module with a full route tree (including a Not Found fallback) and by refactoring App to render an <Outlet /> for the fully authenticated/activated/profile-complete path. REQ-2 is not evidenced in the diff summary because there is no shown change to frontend/src/main.tsx to wrap the app with <RouterProvider> using the created router instance.",

      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Initialize TanStack Router at the application entry point by wrapping the app with RouterProvider so route hooks/components never receive a null router store.",
      "reason": "The diff summary shows a new router instance exported from frontend/src/router.tsx, but does not show any modification to frontend/src/main.tsx to render <RouterProvider router={router}>. Without that entry-point wiring, the router context may still be missing at runtime.",
