  "summary": "Frontend changes implement invite-status-aware admin listing (via a new/updated `useGetInviteCodesWithStatus` hook and updated Admin Invite Management UI) and add React Query invalidations after invite redemption. Backend changes show introduction of an `InviteCodeWithStatus` record and an `invitesWithStatus` map, but the diff excerpt is truncated before any evidence of `redeemInviteCode` actually persisting used/usedAt/usedBy or the admin listing API reading from the same updated source of truth.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Fix backend invite redemption so that an invite code is reliably marked as used (used=true, usedAt set, usedBy set) when redeemed, and ensure the admin invite listing API reads from the same source of truth that is updated on redemption.",
      "reason": "The provided backend diff excerpt only shows new types/storage (`InviteCodeWithStatus`, `invitesWithStatus`) but does not include any visible changes to `redeemInviteCode` or the admin invite listing/query method(s) that would prove used/usedAt/usedBy are set on redemption and later returned to admins from the same storage. Because the file is truncated, this cannot be confirmed from the evidence shown.",
      "evidence": [
        "backend/main.mo (truncated: shows `type InviteCodeWithStatus` and `let invitesWithStatus = Map.empty<Text, InviteCodeWithStatus>();` but no redemption/listing logic visible)"

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "PIN management functionality (set/change/validate/clear PIN) and related React Query hooks were added/modified, which is not part of the invite-status bugfix request.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest focuses on invite redemption status tracking and admin invite list updates; it does not request any PIN feature work.",
      "evidence": [
        "backend/main.mo (truncated: `// PIN Management` section with `setOrChangePin`, `validatePin`, `clearPin`, `hasPin`)",
        "frontend/src/hooks/useQueries.ts (truncated: `useHasPin`, `useSetOrChangePin` and PIN-related invalidations/toasts)"
